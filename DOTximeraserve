#   which shoyuld contains your private GPG key to serve (i.e. publishing online)
#   your Ximera courses

#   first line of the .gitignore file in ximeraFirstSteps.
#   
#   Next, copy DOTximeraserve to the repository you wish to deploy.
#   If you are deploying ximeraFirstSteps, this step is complete.
#
#   Open DOTximeraserve and edit lines 21  and 24--31 below. 
#   Then save this file as .ximeraserve
#   Delete DOTximeraserve
