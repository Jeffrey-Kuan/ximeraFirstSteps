#   This is a TEMPLATE .ximeraserve file
#   It contains the configuration for serving (i.e. publishing online)
#
#   VERY IMPORTANT
#
#   First, ensure that you have added .ximeraserve to the .gitignore file
#
#   You do this by opening .gitignore (or copying it from ximeraFirstSteps)
#   And confirming that there is a line with .ximeraserve listed, it's on the
#   first line of the .gitignore file in ximeraFirstSteps.
#   
#   Next, copy DOTximeraserve to the repository you wish to deploy.
#   If you are deploying ximeraFirstSteps, this step is complete.
#
#   Open DOTximeraserve and edit lines 22, 23, 25, and 28--35 below. 
#   Then save this file as .ximeraserve
#   Delete DOTximeraserve
#   
#   *** DO NEVER COMMIT THE .ximeraserve WITH YOUR REAL KEY ***
