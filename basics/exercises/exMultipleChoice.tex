\begin{exercise}
    Ximera is so awesome because it feels like:
    \begin{multipleChoice}
        \choice         {\ldots doing your taxes}
        \choice         {\ldots writing a book by hand}
        \choice[correct]{\ldots a walk with free ice cream} 
        \choice         {\ldots solving a puzzle blindfolded}
        \choice[correct]{\ldots a tool that makes math fun} 
    \end{multipleChoice}
    \begin{feedback}
        This exercise is implemented with a \verb|multipleChoice| environment,
        but in Ximera this means that there \textit{might} be multiple correct answers,
        but is it sufficient to give one of them.
        \\
        One could have called this also \verb|selectOne|. 
        Use \verb|selectAll| to only get a correct answer when \textit{all} correct options are selected.
        
    \end{feedback}
\end{exercise}
