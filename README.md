# Software requirements and suggestions

Although a standard TeX installation is sufficient to generate PDF versions of your courses, we very strongly suggest to use Git and Docker. We additionally (also very strongly) suggest Visual Studio Code, but editing can be done in your favorite TeX-editor.
To generate interactive websites, use of Git and Docker is required. In the future, this might change (again).


## Installing Git

Git is fundamental to working with Ximera. All Ximera documents that will be deployed online must be in Git repository. If you have no experience with Git, the developers are happy to help get you started with Git, email: `ximera@math.osu.edu`

### Git on Windows

If you use Windows, go to: `https://git-scm.com/download/win ` and the download will start automatically. If it doesn't you probably want "64-bit Git for Windows Setup."

### Git on MacOS

On Mavericks (10.9) or above you can do this simply by trying to run git from the Terminal the very first time. To open the terminal, do one of the following:

- Click the Launchpad icon in the Dock, type Terminal in the search field, then click Terminal.
- In the Finder, open the /Applications/Utilities folder, then double-click Terminal.

Once in the terminal type `git` and hit return. It should look something like:

```console
git
```

If you donâ€™t have it installed already, your computer will prompt you to install it.

### Git on Linux

On Linux, there are various methods. However, if you are on a Debian-based distribution, such as Ubuntu, try:

```console
sudo apt update
```

and then

```
sudo apt install git
```

We suggest you follow the recommendations of Git and also do the following:

```
git config --global core.editor "nano"
```



## Installing Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is a popular free editor and development environment by Microsoft, that integrates git, docker and tex support.
Note the `code` part: Visual Studio is a different and much bigger Microsoft product, that is not needed nor relevant for Ximera.

Download and install form
```
https://code.visualstudio.com/download
```
and accept the default WSL setup (which will enable a Microsoft provided Linux subsystem on your PC).

After starting Open Visual Studio Code, hit `Ctrl-~` to open a Terminal Window, which will initially be PowerShell. It is suggested to enable a more complete Linux system by typing
```console
wsl --install
```
Now at the upper right of the Terminal window you should see "PowerShell + v" menu, and pressing the down-carrot should give an 'Ubuntu (WSL)' option (perhaps with a specific Ubuntu version like 24.04).
This will be needed further to generate a gpg key.



If using Linux with a Debian-based distribution such as Ubuntu, add the Microsoft windows install dependencies before installing Microsoft Visual Studio Code:

```console
sudo apt install software-properties-common apt-transport-https wget -y
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/vscode stable main"
sudo apt update
sudo apt install code
```
You can verify the installation was successful using the following command:

```console
code --version
```

## Installing Docker

Docker is necessary for online deployment. It allows to fix the **version** of all software to use. Moreover, it allows to rapidly test updates and revert back (if necessary) very easily. 
The Ximera `xake` Docker containers contain LaTeX, so if one is willing to work exclusively in Docker, they do not need to install LaTeX.

If you start Docker, accept the license and accept recommendations. Once it asks you to sign in, just "Continue Without Signing In." You may choose to do the survey if you like. Once you finish this, you will see a "Engine running" at the bottom left hand corner of the screen.

### docker on Windows

Follow the directions found [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/). "WSL" is key for our deployment, so be sure to follow those guidelines.

### docker on MacOS

Follow the directions found [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/).

### docker on Linux

Follow the directions found [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/ubuntu/).


## OPTIONAL: Installing LaTeX

Since you can compile and deploy in docker, a local TeX installation is not **strictly** necessary.
If you have one already, you can use it, but you might have to add the Ximera package from CTAN.
And there might be some dependencies on old or new versions of some packages that cause issues...

# Test your software and clone this repository

## Start Docker and VSCode 

Assuming you have Git, Docker, and VS Code installed, you should first start Docker.
Open the Docker Desktop application. It will ask you some questions -- if you are on Windows and it asks about "WSL," accept it, as you need "WSL" (if it asks!). You want to open the Docker Desktop application.  You should be able to do this with some sort of GUI launcher.

Once Docker is open and you have skipped through any other surveys/questions, you will see a "Engine running" at the bottom left hand corner of the screen. 
You can minimize the Docker window.

If on Windows, once you start VS Code, make sure you instal the "WSL Extension." VS Code, may ask you if you want to install this via a window in the lower left-hand corner.



## OPTIONAL: Obtain a GitHub account and "Fork" this repository


For a first impression of Ximera, you can just **clone** this repo on your local PC,
and you won't need a Github account.

For deploying Ximera courses, tt's convenient to have a GitHub account and **fork** this repo to `https://github.com/YOUR-GIT-USER-NAME/ximeraFirstSteps`.
Accounts are free, and educators can request special access.
Once logged in into GitHub, at the top right there will be an option to "Fork" the https://github.com/XimeraProject/ximeraFirstStep repository, which will create your own copy which you can then clone, push and publish, e.g. on https://ximera.osu.edu.



## Clone ximeraFirstSteps

If you choose to forked the repo, you should clone  **your copy** of ximeraFirstSteps.
If not, you clone the https://github.com/XimeraProject/ximeraFirstSteps.git repo.  You will not be able to push your changes, but this will not be needed to get familiar with Ximera, and test the setup on your local device.

For all platforms, upon cloning VS Code will ask if you "trust the authors", which you should,
and also to 'Install recommended extensions', which you also should do.

On Windows there unfortunately is a subtle technical complication that can cause problems.

### On Windows 
If you are running Windows, we strongly suggest (for the time being; this might change) 
to clone INSIDE the WSL Ubuntu system, as follows.

(This is because Windows stores newlines in a textfile differently from Linux/MacOs, and the Ximera build process uses a Linux Docker container,
 and at this point requires (unfortunately) the Linux/MacOs convention)

Hit `Ctrl-~` and you should see something like:

![An image of VS Code powershell](graphicsREADME/powershell.png "The powershell")

Click the arrow on the right:

![Clicking arrow to switch to WSL](graphicsREADME/clickedArrow.png "Click the arrow")

When you have selected "Ubuntu (WSL)" you should see something like:

![An Ubuntu (WSL) Terminal](graphicsREADME/WSL.png "An Ubuntu (WSL) terminal")

Now run
```
git clone https://github.com/XimeraProject/ximeraFirstSteps.git
```
or
```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GIT-USER/ximeraFirstSteps.git
```
where "YOUR-GIT-USER" is replaced with your GitHub username.


Now use VS Code to "Open Folder" and open `ximeraFirstSteps`


### On MacOS and Linux

Start a terminal and run 
```
git clone https://github.com/XimeraProject/ximeraFirstSteps.git
```
or 
```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GIT-USER/ximeraFirstSteps.git
```
where "YOUR-GIT-USER" is replaced with your GitHub username.

You can either clone from any terminal window (or from any Git GUI that you might have), and start VS Code (e.g. in the cloned folder with `code .`), 
or start VS Code, hit `Ctrl-~` to start a terminal, and clone form there.


## Allow extensions

Once you clone this repository, VS Code will ask you, via a pop-up (or a notification flag) in the lower right-hand corner, if you want to install extensions. **Install the suggested extensions.**
Once the extensions are installed, at the bottom right-hand corner of your VS code window you should have four new small buttons, named "PDF," "HTML," "Bake," "Serve," and "Extra".

## PDF/HTML/Bake 

If you open any .tex file, e.g. by typing CTRL-p and typing/selecting basicWorksheet.tex, you can compile it to a PDF by hitting the 'PDF' button
at the right bottom of your screen. Similarly, an HTML version is generated by selecting the 'HTML' button.

The very first time you push one of the buttons a docker image will automatically be downloaded. It's very large, several gigabytes, and will take time.
Later compilations will be much faster.

If you press the "Bake" button, **all** files will be compiled to HTML. The very **first** time it will compile all the documents, and this will take some time. However, the next time you compile, it will only compile updated files and that will be **much** faster.


# Testing the course(s) on your local ximeraserver

## Start a local ximeraserver

Start a ximeraserver on your own PC from the 'Extra' menu. 
(The first time, it will download the docker image, which will take some time.)

A server should start on http://localhost:2000. 
It is accessible with your browser, or even *inside VSCode* with the 'Preview in Simple Browser' option form the Extra menu. (At this point, you have not yet published any courses, and you'll only get a mostly empty screen...)

## Check the file `./scripts/config.txt`

The file `./scripts/config.txt` contains some optional settings for compiling and publishing your courses.
You should not have to change anything to publish to your local ximeraserver. 

## Publish to the testserver

Just hit the 'Serve' button. Make sure you first hit 'Bake', and that all files/changes have been committed. It's not necessary to also 'push' your changes at this point.
You should now have access to the course(s), by default on http://localhost:2000/test.

## Compare with the published course

Once you've deployed the course, you can compare your local version to ours. 
At this time (09/2024), your local version will have a 'KULeuven' styling, but this will change (hopefully) soon, when you'll be able to choose or make more layout options.

â€¢	https://ximera.osu.edu/firststeps24/aFirstStepInXimera
â€¢	https://set.kuleuven.be/voorkennis/firststeps24/aFirstStepInXimera/basics/basicWorksheet
â€¢	https://set.kuleuven.be/voorkennis/firststeps24/variant/aNewlayout/variant/basics/basicWorksheet


The KULeuven version also contains two PDF versions: one with, and one without the answers.

# Publishing the course(s) to a public ximeraserver (needs a gpg key)

The file scripts/config.txt determines where (and with which version of Ximera...) to publish your courses.

The relevant settings are 

* XIMERA_URL contains the (url of) the server on which to publish your repo (`http://localhost:2000/` for test, `https://ximera.osu.edu` for real)
* XIMERA_NAME contains the name (lowercase, no underscores!) under which to publish this repo, eg XIMERA_NAME=testing would publish to https://ximera.osu.edu/testing.

You can save and commit these settings.

But, to deploy to a public server (e.g. the OSU server), a (personal) GPG key is needed. This ensures that no one "overwrites" your online course without you knowing. (Even if this did happen, you can always just re-deploy and contact the Ximera developers).

This personal key is to be saved in a 'hidden' config file `.ximeraserve`, and should **never** be committed and pushed.


This git repo has a `.ximeraserve` with a dummy key and key-id which can be used to publish to localhost, which has to be replaced with your own key and key-id when publishing elsewhere.
In VSCode, the `.ximeraserve` file is by default not visible in the Explorer window, but you can open it with CTRL-o, and then typing `.ximeraserve` (which is in the root folder of your repo).

If you do not yet have a GPG key (check with `gpg --list-keys`), you can generate one with
```
 gpg --gen-key
```
Answer all the questions, but **leave the passphrase blank**.

Note: on MacOS you might not be able to leave the passphrase blank. In this case go to https://gpgtools.org/ and install the GPG Suite. This will provide a GUI that will produce a GPG key with spaces. Delete these spaces and this new key (without spaces) is your key. You should quite your terminal and open a new one. 


In `.ximeraserve`, replace the long hex string in `GPG_KEY_ID=215FC33FAB44D5CCA31A04B2CC78CB561FDC49A8` with your key-id (also of the form `ABCD3562DBF99...29292` or whatever).

You will also need your private key, which you can show with 

```
gpg --armor --export-secret-key
```
or (if you happen to have several keys ...)
```
gpg --armor --export-secret-key ABC...your-key-id...92
```
which will show 
```
-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----

WONTWORKRUdBQR1AFURSBLRVJTigUFJJVkkgQktYVJOcxPQ0sk1CREFEdGU5
...
...  OTHER        ...

...  IN YOUR      ...
...  PRIVATE KEY  ...
...
R1AgUFQkxPQJ0tLQVkFURSBJkgLRV0stLSo=
-----END PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----
```

Copy the key itself, thus the stuff above *without* the  -----BEGIN... en -----END headers :
```
WONTWORKRUdBQR1AFURSBLRVJTigUFJJVkkgQktYVJOcxPQ0sk1CREFEdGU5
...
...  OTHER        ...

...  IN YOUR      ...
...  PRIVATE KEY  ...
...
R1AgUFQkxPQJ0tLQVkFURSBJkgLRV0stLSo=
```
and paste it in `.ximeraserve`, replacing the dummy key:
```
GPG_KEY_ID=ABCD3562DBF99 ... 29292
GPG_KEY=$(
cat <<'EOF'
WONTWORKRUdBQR1AFURSBLRVJTigUFJJVkkgQktYVJOcxPQ0sk1CREFEdGU5
...
... PASTE HERE YOUR PRIVATE KEY (with lots of lines as the one above )...
...  Leave the line above with cat <<'EOF' untouched  
...  and leave also the final lines with EOF and bracket ) untouched  ...
...  Everything in between should become your private key
...
R1AgUFQkxPQJ0tLQVkFURSBJkgLRV0stLSo=
EOF
)
```
Note: leave the 'EOF' and ')' at the end!

Delete the first few lines with comments (that by now are wrong, and might confuse you in the future!), 
and save the `.ximeraserve` file.

Note: `.ximeraserve` will (**or should**) not be updated in git, as it is (**or should be**) in the `.gitignore` file.
You should **NEVER** commit, publish or send your private key.
You may want to make a backup of this file/key in a safe place...

Now, pressing the 'Serve' button in the status bar at the bottom should publish your courses.


# Debugging

You can get an interactive BASH shell **inside** the docker container, with your local folder available under /code.
In this way, you have access to the full tex/ximera settings, and tweak/debug the process.
On exiting and restarting the container again, you'll start again from a clean, standard xake image.
Check the docker documentation if you would want to make permanent changes to the image.

Start a shell with
```
./scripts/xmlatex -i bash
```
Then, you could e.g. 
```
pdflatex FILE.tex
```
or
```
xake -v compile FILE.tex 
```


# Making new courses

There are several options to create a new repo, with new Ximera courses that will deploy online:

## Starting from https://github.com/XimeraProject/ximeraNewProject

You clone [this repo](https://github.com/XimeraProject/ximeraNewProject), REMOVE STUFF, CHANGE THE NAME OF THE REPO and PUSH to your account.
You start adding TeX code ...

## Starting with an existing repository

You follow these steps carefully. 

You'll copy following files and folders from [this repo](https://github.com/XimeraProject/ximeraNewProject) to your repo:
* `.gitignore` 
* `scripts`
* `.vscode`

If there is already a `.gitignore` we suggest you replace your file with ours, or at least check the differences. Did we mention you should never push `.ximeraserve`?
If there is already a folder `.vscode` we suggest you compare your files with ours and check the differences.

The .vscode folder is not needed, but without it, you'll not have the PDF/HTML/Bake/Serve buttons, and you'll have to start 
* `./scripts/xmlatex compilePdf <path-to-your-texfile>`
* `./scripts/xmlatex compile <path-to-your-texfile>`
* `./scripts/xmlatex bake`
* `./scripts/xmlatex serve`

Note: you may need to make xmlatex executable, via
```
chmod +x ./scripts/xmlatex
```
