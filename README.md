## Software requirements and suggestions

To use Ximera, we require that users use Git and Docker.
We additionally (very strongly) suggest Visual Studio Code and LaTeX.

### Installing Git

Git is fundamental to working with Ximera. All Ximera docuements that will be deployed online must be in Git repository. If you have no experience with Git, the developers are happy to help get you started with Git, email: `ximera@math.osu.edu`

#### Windows

If you use Windows, go to: `https://git-scm.com/download/win ` and the download will start automatically. If it doesn't you probably want "64-bit Git for Windows Setup."

#### MacOS

On Mavericks (10.9) or above you can do this simply by trying to run git from the Terminal the very first time. To open the terminal, do one of the following:

- Click the Launchpad icon in the Dock, type Terminal in the search field, then click Terminal.
- In the Finder, open the /Applications/Utilities folder, then double-click Terminal.

Once in the terminal type `git` and hit return. It should look something like:

```console
git
```

If you donâ€™t have it installed already, your computer will prompt you to install it.

#### Linux

On Linux, there are various methods. However, if you are on a Debian-based distribution, such as Ubuntu, try:

```console
sudo apt update
```

and then

```
sudo apt install git
```

We suggest you follow the recommendations of Git and also do the following:

```
git config --global core.editor "nano"
```

### Installing Docker

Docker is necessary for online deployment. It allows us to choose which **version** of software we use. Moreover, it allows us to rapidly test updates and revert back (if necessary) very easily. Our Docker containers contain LaTeX, so if one is willing to work excusively in Docker, they do not need to install LaTeX.

If you start Docker, accept the license and accept recommendations. Once it asks you to sign in, just "Continue Without Signing In." You may choose to do the survey if you like. Once you finish this, you will see a "Engine running" at the bottom left hand corner of the screen.

#### Windows

Follow the directions found [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/). "WSL" is key for our deployment, so be sure to follow those guidelines.

#### MacOS

Follow the directions found [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/).

#### Linux

Follow the directions found [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/ubuntu/).

### Installing Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code gives us a common deploy environment. In particular, on Windows machines it provides a UNIX-like terminal via WSL.
Download from `https://code.visualstudio.com/download` or if you use Linux and are on a Debian-based distribution, such as Ubuntu, try:

```console
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install code
```

### Installing LaTeX

Since we deploy in docker, this is not **strictly** necessary. However, it will enable you to compile documents without using Docker. This can be helpful when developing.

#### Windows

#### MacOS

#### Linux


## Test your software and clone this repository

Assuming you have Git, Docker, and VS Code installed, you should now "clone" this repository. 
To do this,  BLAH


Open VS Code, press `Ctrl-Shift-P` and type "clone" you should see "Git clone"


Will ask to install extensions DO IT

At this point you should see a "Bake" if you press the button then ......



## Deploying this course

To deploy this Ximera "course" aka "xourse" to a Ximera Server, edit `DOTximeraServe`

```
EDIT INSTRUCTIONS
```

You will need to "Show Hidden Files" and save as: `.ximeraserve`

For experienced Git users: Do not attempt to add `.ximeraserve` to the repo, it is already in the `.gitignore` and should not be added.

Start Docker, accept the license and accpet recommendations. Once it asks you to sign in, just "Continue Without Signing In." You may choose to do the survey if you like. Once you finish this, you will see a "Engine running" at the bottom left hand corner of the screen.


You will need a gpp key to deploy the server.

CHECK Ximera Key server!!!


### The published course

Once you've deployed the course, you can compare your output to ours:
- https://ximera.osu.edu/firststeps/course/firstTopic/firstActivity
- https://set.kuleuven.be/voorkennis/firststeps/course/firstTopic/firstActivity

The KULeuven version also contains two PDF versions: one with, and one without the answers.


## Deploying new courses

There are two ways to create a new Ximera course that will deploy online

### Starting from scratch

REMOVE STUFF


### Starting with an existing repo

Please follow these steps You'll need to show hidden files, and then copy the file `.gitignore` to your repo. If there is already a `.gitignore` we suggest you replace your file with ours.

folders

`scripts` and `.vscode` to your repo

You may need to make xmlatex excutieable, via

```
chmod +x ./scritps/xmlatex
```
