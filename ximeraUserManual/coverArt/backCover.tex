  Ximera, pronounced ``chimera,'' (\textbf{X}imera: \textbf{I}nteractive,
  \textbf{M}athematics, \textbf{E}ducation,
  \textbf{R}esources, for \textbf{A}ll) is an open-source platform that provides
  tools for
  authoring and publishing (PDF and Online), open-source, interactive educational
  content, such as textbooks, assessments, and online courses.
  
  
  Authors  write and store their content on their own
  machines and GitHub repositories.
  Authors own their content and decide how to license their content. From a
  single source written in \LaTeX, Ximera generates various output: PDF
  worksheets,
  PDF textbooks, and	PDF solution manuals, and so on. Of most interest,
  Ximera can
  also create online interactive activities:

  The source code used to produce PDFs can also create interactive online
  activities when deployed to a Ximera server. Students access this content via a
  URL or an assignment in their LMS.
