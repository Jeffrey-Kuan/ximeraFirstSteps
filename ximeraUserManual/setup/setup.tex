  How to set up your Ximera files in GitHub.

\maketitle

\textbf{All Ximera files must be hosted in a Git repository}, with additional
files found in \verb!ximeraFirstSteps!. You have two choices when creating new
content:
\begin{itemize}
  \item If you are \textbf{starting fresh}, fork the \texttt{ximeraFirstSteps}
        repository.
  \item If you are starting with an \textbf{existing a Git repository}, that is
        not currently deploying Ximera content, move files
        from \texttt{ximeraFirstSteps} to this repository.
\end{itemize}
We'll address each of these methods in-turn below.
% See the \link[git manual]{http://git-scm.com} for more information about the
% \verb!clone! and \verb!fork! commands.

\section{Starting fresh and forking \texttt{ximeraFirstSteps}}

Forking a repository is well-documented on
\link[GitHub]{https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo}.
Basically, you login to GitHub, return to this page, and at the top right there
will be an option to `Fork' this repository. Fork the repo. Accept all
defaults, though you might want to change the name of the repository at this
point. When done, it will take you to
your copy of this repository on GitHub. It will be located someplace like:
\begin{center}
  \texttt{https://github.com/YOUR-GIT-USER-NAME/your-new-repo-name}
\end{center}
Once the repository is forked, clone the forked repository (the one in your
user-space) onto your computer. \textbf{If you are using Windows, be sure to
  clone through WSL.}
After the repository is on your computer, delete all files \textbf{except:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{.gitignore}
  \item \texttt{DOTximeraserve}
  \item \texttt{.vscode}
  \item \texttt{scripts}
  \item \texttt{.git}
  \item \texttt{README.md}
  \item \texttt{NOT-THE-LICENSE.md}
\end{itemize}
You must keep the files above.	Commit your changes to GitHub and view your
repository online via a web browser to ensure that the files were deleted.

\section{Starting from an existing GitHub repository}

Starting from an existing GitHub repository, you will need to \textbf{copy}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{gitignore}
  \item \texttt{.vscode}
  \item \texttt{scripts}
  \item \texttt{README.md}
  \item \texttt{NOT-THE-LICENSE.md}
\end{itemize}
into your repository. If you already have a \verb|.gitignore| file, we suggest
you replace yours with ours. Commit your changes to GitHub and view your
repository online via a web browser to ensure that the files were added.

\section{Setting up a Ximera \texttt{xourse}}

Ximera documents can be ``taped'' together using the \texttt{xourse} document
class.
A \verb|xourse| file is basically a list of other \verb|ximera| files and even
other \verb|xourse| files.
The \verb|xourse| file for \textit{First Steps in Ximera} can be found here:
\begin{center}

  \url{https://github.com/ximeraProject/ximeraFirstSteps/aFirstStepInXimera.tex}
\end{center}
The \verb!xourse! documentclass specifies information such as the name of the
document, the names fo the authors, a description of
the content, a license and the names of all \LaTeX\ activity files comprising
the
document.

\begin{warning}
  All document and folder names used for Ximera must be web-safe! This means
  all document and folder names:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Must only use alphanumeric English characters, meaning: a,b, \dots,
          z, A,B, \dots, Z, 0,1, \dots, 9, and hyphen `-' and underscore `\_'
          though the
          last two are discouraged.
    \item Cannot use use any other characters, including spaces. This means all
          Ximera documents and folders file names must be a single-word.
  \end{itemize}
  This is not a limitation of Ximera, rather it is a rule that nearly all
  web-accessible documents must follow.
\end{warning}

\section{File-structure}

While one can write a Ximera document without the use of folders, this quickly
turns into a mess that is difficult to understand.
To help others (including your future-self) you should have a file structure
that helps you understand where content is stored.

We recommend the following:
\begin{description}
  \item[Group by concept] Have all documents that are closely related in idea
    or
    scope in the same folder.
  \item[Descriptive file name] Give you documents descriptive file names like:
    \verb!completeTheSquare.tex! or \verb!derivativeRules.tex! rather than
    generic
    names like: \sout{\texttt{chapter1.tex}}, or
    \sout{\texttt{math872ch2sec3.tex}}.
\end{description}

For the repository \texttt{ximeraFirstSteps} we have the following structure:
\begin{center}%%DIAGRAM OF FILE STRUCTURE

We've left some files out of this diagram; regardless, you should be able to
goto
\begin{center}
  \url{https://github.com/ximeraProject/ximeraFirstSteps}
\end{center}
and witness this file-structure. At the top-level of the repository, we have
the documents \verb!preamble.tex! and \verb!aFirstStepInXimera.tex! along with
the folders \verb!basics! and \verb!exercises!. Inside \verb!basics!, we have
two activities and a JPG that is required by one of them. Inside
\verb!exercises!
we have all the practice exercises.
Ideally a document's parent folder would contain everything that document needs
to compile, except for perhaps the preamble, and we address this below.
This set up will allow you and others to easily understand and modify your
content for years to come.

\section{Including with \texttt{\textbackslash activity} and
  \texttt{\textbackslash practice}}

Once you have some files and a basic directory structure, you can add them to
the \verb!xourse! document. In \verb!aFirstStepInXimera.tex! we write

\begin{example}%% We could LOAD the actual file
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass{xourse} 
\input{preamble} %% Loads the graphics path
\author{Wim Obbels \and Bart Snapp}
\title{A First Step in Ximera}
\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
    A simple collection of Ximera activities, 
    to be deployed online.

\maketitle
\activity{basics/basicWorksheet}
\activity{basics/graphicsInteractives}
\practice{exercises/answer}
\practice{exercises/multipleChoice}
\practice{exercises/selectAll}
\practice{exercises/wordChoice}
\practice{exercises/hintsAndFollowUp}
\end{document}
\end{verbatim}
\end{example}

\section{Preambles, input paths, and graphics paths}

\subsection{A common preamble}

\subsection{Graphics paths}

Perhaps the easiest way to include graphics in Ximera documents is with
\verb!\includegraphics!:
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=5cm]{missionPatch.jpg}
\end{center}
The image, also used in \texttt{ximeraFirstSteps}, is in the folder that
contains the Ximera document.
However, when this document is compiled via a \verb!xourse! document, the

\begin{example}
  \begin{verbatim}
%% where to find images
\graphicspath{  
{./}
{./graphicsVideosAndInteractives/}
}    
\end{verbatim}
\end{example}

\subsection{Input paths}

With this said, there are some issues you should be aware of.
