\end{abstract}
\maketitle

There are many ways our friends use Ximera. Some make worksheets, some make
exercise banks, and some make full textbooks. Common to all of these are the
use of interactive elements that students submit answers to. We'll call
anything a student can ``answer'' an \textbf{answerable}.

\begin{warning}
  All answerables must be \textbf{inside of a theorem-like environment}.
\end{warning}

With that said, we'll discuss the basic answerables below, and then described
how they might be used in use cases of: worksheets, exercise banks, and
textbooks.

\section{The \texttt{\textbackslash answer} command}

The basic way of including a answerable item in Ximera is to use the
\verb|\answer| command.

\begin{warning}
  The \verb|\answer| command must be in \textbf{math-mode} (display or inline)
  and also be \textbf{inside of a
    theorem-like environment}.
\end{warning}
Here are some examples of how to use \verb!\answer!:

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{problem}
State the answer to life, the universe, and everything.
\[
\answer{42}
\]
\end{problem}
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{exercise}
Compute:
\[
\frac{d}{dx} \sin(3x) =  \answer{3\cos(3x)}
\]
\end{exercise}
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{question}
For each of the following functions, find $x$ such that it is a critical point, or write ``NA'' if none exists.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item For $f(x) = |x-4|$, $x$ is a critical point when $x=\answer{4}$.
  \item For $g(x) = x^2-4x+1$, $x$ is a critical point when $x=\answer{2}$.
  \item For $h(x) = 3x-2$, $x$ is a critical point when $x=\answer[format=string]{NA}$.
Find $x$ such that where $f(x) = |x-4|$ has a critical point or
\end{question}
\end{verbatim}

There are also a number of optional arguments that can be passed
to the \verb|\answer| command.
\begin{description}
  \item[tolerance] The Tolerance key-value sets a $\pm$ value on the
    author's (numeric) answer that will be accepted from a student. For
    example,
    the answer box \verb|\answer[tolerance=5]{100}| will accept anything in
    the range of $[95,105]$ as correct.
  \item[format=string] This is for validating ``words'' typed into an answer
    box. Here
    \verb|$\answer[format=string]{Cat}$| will validate \verb!Cat!,
    \verb!cAt!,\verb!caT!, \verb!cat! all as
    correct. However, if spaces are inserted before, between, or after, it will
    be marked as incorrect.
  \item[given] Sometimes you will need to show an answer in the PDF for the
    content to be understandable in a PDF setting. Here ``given'' means that
    the
    answer is ``given'' to the student in the PDF.
  \item[validator] This is an advanced topic. This key-value allows you to load
    a validator in-line
    from a prior javascript environment.
  \item[id] This is an advanced topic. This is used to set an id for the
    student's answer, which can be
    called by a validator or some other code.
\end{description}

\begin{warning}
  You separate options in \verb!\answer! using commas and there can be no
  spaces, like this:
  \begin{verbatim}
\[
\answer[given,tolerance=5]{100}
\]
\end{verbatim}
\end{warning}

\paragraph{Validating an answer}

Ximera uses more than a dozen algorithms to check if the student's provided
answer is mathematically equivalent to the content author's provided answer. If
any report the answer as being correct, then it is marked as correct.

There are confounds for validating answers online:
\begin{description}
  \item[Student input] for answers a nontrivial task. Students need to be able
    to easily type in their answers.
  \item[Checking for equality] will not reveal the form of the answer. This
    means that sometimes the `answer' to the question can be the question
    itself. For example  \verb!1+2 = \answer{3}! can be answered with `$1+2$'
    because
    that \textit{equals} $3$.
    \item[Richardson's theorem ]\link[states it is not
      possible]{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richardson\%27s\_theorem}
    to decide equality between the expressions of involving integers, $\pi$,
    logarithms and exponential and sine functions.
  \item[Floating-point numbers] can lead to erroneous computations, leading to
    identifying nonequal expressions as equal.
\end{description}
In abstract, each of these confounds are quite daunting. However, in practice,
they can be mitigated via Ximera's design along with thought on the author's
side when constructing problems.

\paragraph{Student input} To aid the student with inputting math, Ximera
displays what it believes the student is typing. In addition, we provide a math
pallet. Authors can assist students with input by ensuring that the required
answer is not too difficult to type in.

\paragraph{It checks for equality}
Although the validation technique is impressively comprehensive in
practice, that can be problematic when you want the answer in a specific
\textit{form}. For example if you want students to sum numbers, you will have to use 
\begin{verbatim}
\[
1+2 = \answer[format=string]{3}
\]
\end{verbatim}
For other specific forms, like factoring polynomials, you will need to use a custom validator. 

\paragraph{Ximera is not designed for high-stakes assessment} All content is
open and students can find the source if they look hard enough. Moreover,
Answers can be exposed via right-click. This has the even more unfortunate
side-effect that a student can mess up their browser settings to the point that
Ximera content will not render.

For accessibility reasons (like screen readers and the like) the library
that powers the answer box has a bunch of features bundled in, one of which is
the ability to right-click and get different formatting of its contents.
Unfortunately, if you right-click and go to ``show math as'' and then ``tex
commands'' you can very easily see the contents of the answer command that was
used in the answer file. This information isn't necessary for accessibility
(after all, the answer box is suppose to contain the actual content supplied by
the student, and doesn't have any content the student needs to know about) but
it's tied to the behavior of the underlying library that supports \textit{all}
the rendered math on the page, so we can't remove it without killing
\textit{all} accessibility.

However, it is easily countered in the specific case of the answer box,
which we detail in the
\href{https://xronos.clas.ufl.edu/examples/exampleCore/supplemental/hiddenAnswers}{how
  to hide answers} section of the documentation, for those that are interested.

\paragraph{Ricardson's theorem} forces the developers of Ximera to make a
decision:
\begin{itemize}
  \item To sometimes count correct submissions as incorrect.
  \item To sometimes count incorrect submissions as correct.
\end{itemize}
For the Ximera platform, we chose to \textbf{sometimes count incorrect
  submissions as correct}. This means that if the \verb|\answer| command
can't understand your provided answer, then it will default to mark
\textit{any} answer from the student correct. In practice, if you find that you
have an answer box that is marking anything/everything correct, this is
probably because there is some kind of typo or character
in the answer box that it cannot understand.

\paragraph{Floating-point computations} are a fact-of-life when working with computers. 

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{example}
Compute
\[
10+ 2^40 = \answer{10+ 2^40}
\]
\end{example}
\end{verbatim}

Ximera accepts it as correct, even though we obviously know that's not
true. But that's because $2^{-40}$ is a number that is too small for machine
precision - so to the computer \textit{running} Ximera, it is effectively
indistinguishable from zero. This is just an inherent restriction based on the
machine running Ximera, rather than Ximera itself - but it can be important to
be aware of, since it can crop up in other ways. For example, if you have
something like $e^{-200|x|^{100}}$, then almost regardless of what number
Ximera picks in the complex plane, chances are excellent that the result would
be too small for machine precision to detect - meaning that the entire
\textit{function} is indistinguishable from the constant zero. This can crop up
as a result of integrating or differentiating weird functions that end up
having extra terms that it is important for students to realize exist (e.g. you
want to verify they used the chain rule and not just the base derivative rule)
but the ``extra part'' doesn't seem to matter to Ximera - this is typically an
issue of machine precision.

\paragraph{Answers are exposed via right-click}

For accessibility reasons (like screen readers and the like) the library
that powers the answer box has a bunch of features bundled in, one of which is
the ability to right-click and get different formatting of its contents.
Unfortunately, if you right-click and go to ``show math as'' and then ``tex
commands'' you can very easily see the contents of the answer command that was
used in the answer file. This information isn't necessary for accessibility
(after all, the answer box is suppose to contain the actual content supplied by
the student, and doesn't have any content the student needs to know about) but
it's tied to the behavior of the underlying library that supports \textit{all}
the rendered math on the page, so we can't remove it without killing
\textit{all} accessibility.

However, it is easily countered in the specific case of the answer box,
which we detail in the

\paragraph{Answer box size}
If you are in a situation where you want a student to solve for a portion
of an expression or formula, you should place parenthesis around the answer
box. Since the answer box is a different size than the answer you should use
\verb!\left! and \verb!\right! to do it like
this:
\begin{verbatim}
\[
  \left(\answer{42}\right)
\]
\end{verbatim}
and here we see this in context:
%% Inspired by an exercise of Jim Talamo
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{exercise}
Given a normal vector $\vec{n} = (a,b,c)$ and a point
$(x_0,y_0,z_0)$, the equation of the plane with normal
vector $\vec{n}$ that passes through $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ is
given by
\[
  a(x-x_0)+b(y-y_0)+c(z-z_0) = 0.
\]
Find the equation of a plane with normal vector $(2,-1,9)$
that passes through $(2,-3,4)$. Express your final answer
in the form $ax+by+cz=d$.
\[
  2x+\left(\answer{-1}\right)y+\left(\answer{9}\right)z
  = \answer{43}.
\]
\end{exercise}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Answers with \texttt{\textbackslash choice}}

There are three similar answerables that all use the command \verb!\choice!. In
each case, the order of the choices presented to the student is the order the
author types in the code. The author marks correct answers with the option
\verb!correct! and leaves incorrect answers without options:
\begin{verbatim}
\choice[correct]{SOME-CORRECT-ANSWER}
\choice{SOME-INCORRECT-ANSWER}
\end{verbatim}
Let's see some examples now.
\paragraph{Multiple Choice}
Writing multiple choice, including True/False, questions is easy.
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{question}
Which of the following functions has a graph which is a parabola?
\begin{multipleChoice}
  \choice[correct]{$y=x^2+3x-3$}
  \choice{$y = \frac{1}{x+2}$}
  \choice{$y=3x+1$}
\end{multipleChoice}
\end{question}
\end{verbatim}
They may more than one correct answer and with \verb!multipleChoice!, any
correct answer will result in completion of this answerable.
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{problem}
Select a prime number:
\begin{multipleChoice}
  \choice{1}
  \choice[correct]{2}
  \choice[correct]{3}
  \choice{4}
  \choice[correct]{5}
\end{multipleChoice}
\end{problem}
\end{verbatim}
With \verb!multipleChoice! the student is only able to select one answer before
submitting. This could be useful for student surveys where every choice is
marked as correct.

\paragraph{Select All}
With \verb!selectAll! the student is able to select any and all answers before
submitting.
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{problem}
Select all prime numbers:
\begin{selectAll}
  \choice{1}
  \choice[correct]{2}
  \choice[correct]{3}
  \choice{4}
  \choice[correct]{5}
\end{selectAll}
\end{problem}
\end{verbatim}
These problems can be very challenging for students. Authors can quickly make
questions that are quite difficult without realizing it.

\paragraph{Word choice}
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{exercise}
 Consider the planes defined by the equations below.
\begin{align*}
  P_1:  \quad 4&= 2x-y+3z  \\
  P_2:  \quad  5&=4x-2y+6z\\ 
  P_3:  \quad  7&=5x+2y+z
\end{align*}
Describe the relationships between the planes $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_3$
in terms of ``parallel,'' ``orthogonal,'' or ``neither.''
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The planes $P_1$ and $P_2$ are \wordChoice{
    \choice[correct]{parallel}
    \choice{orthogonal}
    \choice{neither parallel nor orthogonal}}.
  \item The planes $P_1$ and $P_3$ are \wordChoice{
    \choice{parallel}
    \choice{orthogonal}
    \choice[correct]
    {neither parallel nor orthogonal}}.
  \item The planes $P_2$ and $P_3$ are \wordChoice{
    \choice{parallel}
    \choice{orthogonal}
    \choice[correct]{neither parallel nor orthogonal}}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Expanding problem types}

One thing you might want to have on a worksheet are problems that unfold as
students work. We have special environments for this.

While \textbf{any} environment can contain the command \verb|\answer|,
there are four special environments: \verb|question|, \verb|exercise|,
\verb|problem|, \verb|exploration|. If these environments are nested within
each other, They ``hide'' the inside environment. For example

\begin{problem}
Expanding Problen
\end{problem}

\end{document}
